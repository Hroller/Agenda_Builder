---

## ‚úÖ Features
- Supports three group types:
  - Oriental-Rabboni Chapter No. 78 RAM
  - Jeremiah Council No. 48

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

No external packages need to be installed.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system

### Steps
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows)
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved:
   ```
   cd path\to\your\script
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python Agenda_Builder2.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Select a group (1, 2, or 3)
   - Enter the meeting date in a valid format (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `5/29/24`, or `May 29, 2024`)
   - Enter agenda items for each category, seperate multiple agenda items in the same catagory with commas (,)

---

## üìÅ Output

Files are created in the same directory as the script:
- Example:
  - `OR78_agenda_2024-06-20.txt`
  - `OR78_minutes_2024-06-20.txt`

---

## üîí Notes

- You may edit the generated `.txt` files after creation if needed

Created by Mike Martin, customized with flexibility and Masonic structure in mind.



BELOW IS DEPRECATED: It still works, but I've made the new script (Agenda_Builder2.0) MUCH simpler and easier to use:
I wanted a tool to build an agenda for Masonic meetings and also create a Meeting Minutes outline.

You do need to install the python-docx library to use this, pip install python-docx

How It Works:

  Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Launch the Script

Run: python Agenda_Maker2.py

2. Select the Group

Choose from:

1: Oriental-Rabboni Chapter No. 78 RAM

2: Jeremiah Council No. 48

3: Webster Groves Lodge No. 84

4: Ivanhoe Commandery No. 8

5: Other (enter custom name)

3. Enter the Meeting Date

Format: YYYY-MM-DD

Example: 2025-05-05

4. Choose File Format

Type y for Word (.docx)

Type n for Text (.txt)

5. Choose Mode

(C)reate New Agenda/Minutes

(E)dit Existing Agenda/Minutes

6. (Create Mode)

Enter unapproved minutes dates or type 0/none.

Enter items for each category when prompted.

7. (Edit Mode)

Script automatically creates timestamped backups (e.g., agenda_2025-05-05_20240501-1530.docx).

Edit Menu Options:

1: Add item

2: Remove item

3: View current agenda

4: Reorder items

5: Undo last change

6: Save and Exit

8. Successful Save

Agenda and Minutes files are saved with the entered date.

You will see: All tasks completed successfully. Goodbye!

Notes:

Backup copies are timestamped to prevent overwriting.

Word documents use Times New Roman font.

Reordering accepts comma-separated numbers.

If existing files are found in Create mode, you must confirm overwrite.

Common Errors and Solutions:

Invalid date format: Must use YYYY-MM-DD.

Typing non-numeric input when selecting category/item number: prompts a retry.
