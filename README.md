I wanted a tool to build an agenda for Masonic meetings and also create a Meeting Minutes outline.

How It Works:

    Group Selection:

        Options 1â€“4 are prepopulated groups.

        Option 5 allows you to type in your own group name.

    Meeting Date:

        You enter the meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format and it is then formatted as "Month Day, Year" for display.

    Format Choice:

        You choose Microsoft Word format (.docx) by entering y; otherwise, the output is plain text (.txt).

    Agenda Items:

        For "Unapproved minutes from the last meeting", you may enter multiple dates (comma-separated) in YYYY-MM-DD format.

        If you enter "0", "O", "none" (case-insensitive) or nothing, the function returns ["None"] so that "None" is printed in the output.

    Output:

        The script generates the agenda and minutes documents according to the chosen format.
